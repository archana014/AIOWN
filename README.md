## üìù Project Description: **AI Agent using Browser-Use & Web-UI**

This project is a beginner-friendly implementation of a **custom AI agent** that can interact with web content and perform tasks via a browser-based user interface. It leverages **Python**, **Playwright**, and the **browser-use** library to simulate intelligent browsing behavior. The **web-ui** provides an accessible frontend for users to interact with the agent ‚Äî all without writing a single line of code.

The AI agent is powered by **Google Gemini API** (via Google AI Studio), enabling it to understand commands, search content, and automate tasks through natural language instructions.

The project is ideal for:

* Students working on AI 
* Tech enthusiasts exploring autonomous agents
* Developers prototyping AI assistant tools
